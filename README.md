# MY-PASS-password-manager

I developed a password manager using tkinter and the real inspiration for this project came about while I was trying to create a account in a website  
so I developed a project called my pass - password generator 
We can used this to store and generate password .  I imported library  pyperclip for copy and paste the generated psswd from the clipboard after the data gets added to a text file which I ll have on my computer  so this is not a internet based service it can keep everything on our computer it is safer than using a third party service
